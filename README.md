# All-in-one project: Visualization, SQL and Python
I create this for applying for Data Analyst role, which would cover a lot of knowlege fields. And it's fun to do since I can choose the techstack.

### What I did
I don't have much time so I will explain my work here:
- Using Python script to initiate the database, and load the `.csv` files as tables.
- Using PowerBI to do the dashboard.
- Extracting information from the database to Jupyter notebook, and querying directly from the SQL database for the result. 
- (If okay) Using some kinds of method to do the ML.
